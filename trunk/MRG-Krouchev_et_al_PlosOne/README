Matlab code of the MRG model [1] as it was used in [2]. The implementation was initially developed for [3] and both versions can be downloaded at https://code.google.com/p/mrg-matlab/ . Calling fr2m creates figure 10A of [2]. Note that sundialsTB needs to be installed (free download at http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html).
