Reimplementation of the axon model of McIntyre, Richardson and Grill (2002) in MATLAB for extracellular stimulations (initially developed for Danner et al., 2011).

The current version (1.3, rev 38) for extracellular stimulation can be found in the SVN repository since downloads are no longer supported by google code:
https://code.google.com/p/mrg-matlab/source/browse/trunk/mcintyre_final.m

The code as it was used in Krouchev et al. (2014) can be found at:
